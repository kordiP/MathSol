# MathSol
My attempt at making a program, that could solve every math problem I can think of.

ðŸ¤“ I am a big fan of mathematics and programming, so I decided to combine them and make a program that solves any math problems I give it! ðŸ™ƒ

- Note that this is the first time I am going to attempt doing such complex (for me) and big projects, so don't expect optimised, bugless or even a completely finished program. I am motivated and will try everything to make this program become true.

It is going to include solving algorithms for:

// add different types, add pictures, emojies and make it pretty.

 - Also note that I am giving myself a deadline of 15 of September, but will continue working afterwards if neccessary.
 
 That's all for now, will keep this updated, stay safe everyone!
