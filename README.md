# What the project does 🤔
📐 My attempt at making a program, that could solve every math problem I can solve. 

- 🤓 I am a big fan of mathematics and programming, so I decided to combine them and make a program that solves any math problems I give it! 🙃

- 🖊 Note that this is the first time I am going to attempt doing such complex (for me) and big projects, so don't expect optimised, bugless or even a completely finished program. I am motivated and will try everything to make this program become true.

# It is going to include solving algorithms for 😮

// going to add different types, add pictures, emojies and make it pretty(for the whole ReadMe). 😐

 - 🖊 Also note that I am giving myself a deadline of 15 of September, but will continue working afterwards if neccessary. 📅
 
 # Why the project is useful 🤔
 - 👍 Generaly speaking, it could help anyone that wants a shortcut to solving a math problem, but I do it for my personal gain of having an automated solver.
 
 # How users can get started with the project 🤔
 - 🤞 I intend and hope to make it as simple as possible, by just downloading the program and running it, in which it would register several inputs to get to the correct output.
 
 # Where users can get help with your project 🤔
 - 🤗 I also intend on making a option to output all available commands and the options they can input, with a description to all of them. 
 
 # Who maintains and contributes to the project 🤔
 - 😮💡 I am doing this project to build experience and to test MY limits, so generaly speaking I strafe towards doing this alone. However, one more person has shown some interest in the idea and I might consider adding them!
 

# ❤️ That's all for now, will keep this updated, stay safe everyone, and thanks for stopping by! 👋😄
